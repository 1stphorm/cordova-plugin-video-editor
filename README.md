This is a cordova plugin to assist in several video editing tasks such as:

* Transcoding
* Trimming
* Taking still images from time moments

After looking at an article on [How Vine Satisfied Its Need for Speed](http://www.technologyreview.com/view/510511/how-vine-satisfies-its-need-for-speed/), it was clear Cordova/Phonegap needed a way to modify videos to be faster for app's that need that speed.

This plugin will address those concerns, hopefully.
